## About

This repository provides an Xcode project for building a simple TOTP application. The codebase was designed to be easy to understand, customize and extend as needed and it supports the following features:

* Scanning QR code invitations with the device camera.
* Handling deep links from email or browsers using the [otpauth](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format) scheme.
* Using the iOS keychain for storing secret keys.
* Built with a simple MVVM architecture to make customization easier.
